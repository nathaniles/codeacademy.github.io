    <td> This week we continued with codecademy. I was working on numbers where there was a list of numbers and it had to choose one of the numbers and multiply that by two. I managed to complete that and I asked a friend to help me with that exercise. I then moved onto the next stage where there was a set of numbers and it had to choose one and find the square of it. I managed to complete that task fine. I then moved onto 60%. </td>
